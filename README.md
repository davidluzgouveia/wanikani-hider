# WaniKani Hider

Hides solutions until you hover while browsing content by level on [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) (a great website for learning japanese kanji). Useful for doing self-study outside of the prescribed reviews. To use create a new script on [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) and copy the contents of [`script.js`](script.js) into it.
